My name is Mauricio Herrera. I am a Product Manager with over five years of experience leading products from Ed-Tech startups, to state governments, and global tech giants such as IBM.

I specialize in making intuitive applications that help expert users handle complexity in specialized domains. I sometimes work in projects for general users, but I find the harder problems more fun.

I love movies, and think about stuff. All our lives we spend them thinking, so I thought, why not [write some of it down?](http://www.herrera.wiki/2023/10/19/About-existence.html)

This is my way of sharing some thoughts, and some of my work.
